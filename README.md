# PokeMahn


Pokemahn is a project built in the Godot engine, incorporating C#, which is a simplified version of a Pokémon game. It tries to capture the “essence” of Pokémon, as well as have playable features that resemble the core series. The game features a tilemap-based overworld, animated player movement, encounter triggers in tall grass, and battles. This lays the foundation for a full RPG system. Data is stored using scenes and scripts combined with basic UI for messages/battles. The goal of this project was to imitate the core mechanics from the original game series while also attempting to keep the scope manageable, which is why it turned out to be more of a "mini-game". Future versions aim to implement catch animations and mechanics, full battles, and add all the items. This project shows how many complex mechanics are broken down into smaller components using Godot's scene system and abilities with scripting, but also highlights how many of those small pieces of the puzzle exist with the limited capabilities of this mini game.
